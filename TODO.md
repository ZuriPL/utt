# PRIORITY

[x] rewrite hash() to work as a pipe
[x] rewrite test validators to use streams
[x] rewrite loader.ts/runner.ts to work with new .utest format (.zip)
[x] reporting the test status
[] advanced test status reporting
[] break up sdk.ts (and the base Test class) into separate objects

# PROGRAM

[] implement push/pull
[] clean up dependencies
[] move test scripts back to .ts, transpiling with esbuild? or native deno?
[] smaller executable (somehow)

# Test execution

[] Parallel test running
[] Output formatting
[] Asynchronous test state reporting
[] Performance tracking (/usr/bin/time, perf)
[] Valgrind support
[] rewrite runner/finder/compiler so that they can share code 

# SDK

[x] hash() function (parsing)
[x] line()
[] define() for creating objects
[x] rewrite parse (and other parts of the compiler/runner) to use streams
[] Multi tests

# NOTES

- breaking up files into a mixin is left for {break up sdk.ts}
- by multi tests i mean a test that generates n (i. e. 100) instances of itself with randomized values, so esentially generators
- define(): in general, methods that make it easier to create input. For example, if the program requires us to create objects before they can
operate on them, there should be a helper to generate these creations/deletions automatically in the test
- push/pull refers to a system for uploading and downloading test packages. 
2 possibilities for this system are: 
a) a web server accepting GET/POST requests for gzipped tars containing .utest files. potential for abuse, and it has to be hosted somewhere (maybe on students?)
b) integration with git, would use git to create repos from a publicly available template, repos would be owned by whoever wrote the tests. Potentially unfeasable. A big plus for this solution is that it'd allow for automatic setting up of packages preloaded with the compiled binary alongside the tests, with no extra steps from the test author
